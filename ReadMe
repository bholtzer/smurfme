UI (ViewModel)

Domain (UseCases)

Data (Repository)

Layer	Responsibility
domain	Core business rules (pure Kotlin, no Android imports)
data	Implements repositories, connects to Firebase + API
presentation	UI (Compose), ViewModels, Navigation
app/di	Hilt setup, dependency wiring

The ViewModel doesn’t know where the data comes from (Firebase, API, etc.),
it just calls getAllSmurfs() or smurfImage(url).
